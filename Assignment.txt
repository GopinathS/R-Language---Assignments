                                                  Assignment - 1: 

1) How many games has India won? 

nrow(ODI[ODI$Winner=="India",])
 375

2) What is the highest score in an inning?

max(ODI[,6],ODI[,7])
 438

3) How many games were played in 1980 and 2010?

nrow(ODI[(ODI$Matchyear==1980 | ODI$Matchyear==2010),])
 119

4) How many games were won by India in 1980?

nrow(ODI[ODI$Matchyear==1980 & ODI$Winner=="India",])
 3

5) What is India's win % since 1980? 

(nrow(ODI[ODI$Winner=="India" & ODI$Matchyear>=1980,]) / nrow(ODI[(ODI$Team1=="India" | ODI$Team2=="India") & ODI$Matchyear>=1980,]) ) * 100

51.44429


6) Bonus: Who has won most games? 

     Most<-aggregate(ODI$Winner,list(ODI$Winner),FUN=length)
     Most[which(max(Most$x)==Most$x) ,]
     
         Group.1   x
      1 Australia 470



                                                   Assignment - 2 :  

1)  Barplot of the number of India wins in games against Pak year-over-year  

           IWon<-ODI[ODI$Winner=="India",]
           VersusPak<-IWon[IWon$Team1=="Pakistan" | IWon$Team2=="Pakistan",]
           x<-aggregate(VersusPak$Matchyear,list(VersusPak$Matchyear),FUN=length)
           barplot(x[,2],names.arg=x[,1],ylim=c(0,7))
   
2)  Barplot of India's % wins in each ground_country
  

        Played<-ODI[ODI$Team1=="India"|ODI$Team2=="India",c("Team1","Team2","Winner","Ground_Country")]
           indiawin<-ODI[ODI$Winner=="India",c("Winner","Ground_Country")]
            winner_GrdCountry<-aggregate(indiawin$Ground_Country,list(indiawin$Ground_Country),length)
            PlayedTotal<-aggregate(Played$Ground_Country,list(Played$Ground_Country),length)
            merge(winner_GrdCountry,PlayedTotal,by="Group.1")
            mergedGC<-merge(winner_GrdCountry,PlayedTotal,by="Group.1")
            percentage<-mergedGC[(mergedGC$x.x/mergedGC$x.y)*100,]
            PercentGrndCountry<-cbind(mergedGC,(mergedGC[,2]/mergedGC[,3])*100)
            A<-PercentGrndCountry[,1]
            B<-PercentGrndCountry[,4]
            barplot(B,names.arg=A,ylim=c(0,70))

3)     Barplot of Top 10 grounds with most number of matches
   

           Ground<-aggregate(ODI$Ground,list(ODI$Ground),FUN=length)
           Ordered<-Ground[order(-Ground$x),]
           topten<-Ordered[1:10,]
           barplot(topten[,2],names.arg=topten[,1],Groundlim=c(0,350))
           
           
           
           
           

                                                        Assignment -3 (Test):


Row count :
---------

awk 'BEGIN {}{n++} END {print (n)}' Cricket.txt

Column count : 
------------
awk 'BEGIN{FS=";"};END {print NF}' Cricket.txt

Replace : by ,
--------------

sed 's/;/,/g' Cricket.txt > ODI.txt


Side effects reading the file in R and  Excel :

In R language : We use to read the file by using seperator but in this case , we need to use (,) comma as a separator which is present almost in all the columns.
In Excel : Opening any text file by Excel will ask for a  delimiter which is again (,) and cause the same issue like above.

These are my views on R and Excel , please correct if it is wrong.
